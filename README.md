# Enumxploit Script

The Enumxploit script is designed to assist in the process of enumeration and privilege escalation in a target environment. It consists of two main parts: Enumeration and Privilege Escalation.

## Enumeration

The Enumeration part of the script aims to gather all the necessary details about the target system or network. It helps in identifying vulnerabilities, services, configurations, and other critical information required for subsequent steps.

## Privilege Escalation

The Privilege Escalation part of the script focuses on techniques and methods to elevate privileges within the target system. It provides various approaches and exploits that can be used to obtain a root shell or gain higher-level access privileges.

Please note that this script should only be used in controlled environments with proper authorization. Unauthorized use or misuse of this script may violate legal and ethical boundaries.

## Usage

This repository contains four scripts. For proper usage, please ensure the following distribution of scripts:

On the Victim Machine:
enumxploit.sh
linux_exploit_suggester.sh

On the Attacking Machine:
Privesc.sh
exploit.c

Please make sure to transfer the respective scripts to the appropriate machines to ensure the correct execution of the exploit. 
To use the Enumxploit script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and authorizations to run the script.
3. Modify the script according to your specific requirements or configurations.
4. Execute the script, following any provided instructions or command-line arguments.
5. Review the output and results carefully to make informed decisions during the enumeration and privilege escalation process.

## Credit

The Linux Exploit Suggester tool, an integral part of enumxploit, was developed by Z-Labs. We extend our gratitude to the  Z-Labs team for creating this valuable tool that helps identify potential exploits based on known vulnerabilities in Linux systems. The integration of Linux Exploit Suggester in enumxploit significantly enhances the privilege escalation capabilities and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the script.
